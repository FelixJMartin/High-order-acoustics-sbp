### Assignment 1 – Task 1: Well-posed Boundary Conditions

Well-posedness is analyzed using the **energy method**.  
Taking the inner product of the governing equation with \(u\) and integrating by parts yields the energy rate

\[
\frac{d}{dt}\|u\|^2
=
u^\ast \mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{A}u \Big|_{x_r}^{x_l}
-
\|u\|_{2\mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{D}}^2,
\]

where the volume terms vanish due to symmetry and  
\(\mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{D} = (\mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{D})^\ast \ge 0\).

### Boundary Contribution

The boundary term is
\[
u^\ast \mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{A}u
=
\rho c^2 p v + \frac{1}{\rho} p v.
\]

Imposing the general boundary conditions
\[
p + a_l v = 0 \quad \text{at } x=x_l, \qquad
p + a_r v = 0 \quad \text{at } x=x_r,
\]
the energy rate becomes
\[
-(\rho c^2 a_l + \tfrac{a_l}{\rho}) v^2 \Big|_{x_l}
+
(\rho c^2 a_r + \tfrac{a_r}{\rho}) v^2 \Big|_{x_r}.
\]

To ensure non-increasing energy, the parameters must satisfy
\[
\boxed{a_l > 0, \qquad a_r < 0.}
\]

### Characteristic Boundary Conditions

The eigenvalues of \(-\mathbf{C}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\) are
\[
\lambda = \pm c,
\]
corresponding to left- and right-traveling waves.

Choosing
\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
p + c v &= 0, \quad x = x_l, \\
p - c v &= 0, \quad x = x_r,
\end{aligned}
}
\]
imposes **characteristic (absorbing) boundary conditions**, eliminating incoming characteristics and yielding a well-posed problem.
