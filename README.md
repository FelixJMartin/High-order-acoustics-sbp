### 🔹 Task 1: 2D Acoustic Wave Equation on a Square Domain

We solve the two-dimensional acoustic wave equation on the square domain:
\[
\Omega = [-1,\,1] \times [-1,\,1]
\]

The governing equations are:
\[
C u_t + A u_x + B u_y + D u = 0
\]

with the solution vector:
\[
u = \begin{bmatrix} p & v & w \end{bmatrix}^T
\]

#### Boundary Conditions
Normal velocity is set to zero on all boundaries:
- \( v = 0 \) on \( \partial\Omega_E \cup \partial\Omega_W \)
- \( w = 0 \) on \( \partial\Omega_S \cup \partial\Omega_N \)

These boundary conditions are shown to yield a **well-posed initial boundary-value problem**.

#### Initial Conditions
\[
p(x,y,0) = e^{-100(x^2 + y^2)}, \quad
v(x,y,0) = 0, \quad
w(x,y,0) = 0
\]

Material parameters are set to:
- \( \rho = 1 \)
- \( c = 1 \)
- \( \beta = 0 \)

### 🔹 Discretization and Numerical Method

The domain is discretized using an **equidistant \( m \times m \) grid** with spacing:
\[
h = \frac{2}{m-1}
\]

To efficiently construct the 2D operators, **Kronecker products** are used:
\[
D_x = D \otimes I, \qquad D_y = I \otimes D
\]

The semi-discrete SBP-Projection formulation is:
\[
u_t = - P C^{-1} (D_x + D_y + D) P u
\]

All matrices are stored in **sparse format** to reduce memory usage and computational cost.
